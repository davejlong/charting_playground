Sign is posted on bus as well as on their site \r\n\r\n\r\nSystem-wide Bus Service Updates\r\n\r\nBUS FARE INCREASES TAKE EFFECT JANUARY 19, 2014 \r\n(12/11/2013)\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) announced today that most CTTRANSIT and ADA Paratransit fares will increase effective January 19, 2014. As a result of public input received during the fare increase process, some of the proposed fare increases were reduced and transfer policies have been improved.\r\n\r\nWith the new fare structure, a one-way cash fare for CTTRANSIT local bus service will increase from $1.30 to $1.50. One-way ADA Paratransit service will increase to $3.00, and ADA Paratransit 10-trip books will cost $24.00. For express bus passengers who use flash passes instead of a 31-day pass, the fare increase will be effective for the month of February 2014.\r\n\r\nWhile most fares are rising, some fares will decrease in price. A local bus one-day unlimited ride pass will decrease to $3.00, or the cost of just one round trip fare. The three-day pass will also see a slight decrease in price.\r\n\r\nAlso effective on January 19, 2014, the length of time for transfers will increase from ninety minutes to two hours. Transfers will be valid for unlimited rides on local CTTRANSIT buses going in any direction for two hours from the time issued. A transfer is issued upon request when the fare is paid upon boarding the bus.\r\n\r\n\"We realize that it is a difficult time to raise fares,\" said CT DOT Commissioner James Redeker, noting that the Department has held the line on fares since January 2012, which was the first increase in seven years. \"Unfortunately operating expenses dictate the need to raise fares to maintain the current level of service. We've done our best to moderate the impact on our riders by listening to the feedback gathered during the public comment process.\"\r\n\r\nThe new fare structure will retain discounted rates for seniors, youth, and people with disabilities. The new fare structure is attached as part of this news release.\r\n\r\nCTTRANSIT is the state-owned bus transit system serving the greater Hartford, New Haven, Stamford, Waterbury, New Britain, Meriden, Bristol and Wallingford areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor More Information: http://www.ct.gov/dot/cwp/view.asp?A=1373&Q=536600 \r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Detailed fare information.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPowered by Translate\r\n PDF Usage | Privacy Policy | Resources | Title VI Policy\t\r\n\r\n\tCTTRANSIT, 100 Leibert Road, P.O.
