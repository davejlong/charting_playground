When it was turned into an intersection, it was obviously completed based on the maximum effect with the minimum budget, but it does not work. It is a poor design and quite frankly negligent of the Engineer. Generally at an intersection like this, turning lanes would be designed so that if signaled simultaneously their flow would not cross paths; the alternative would be to signal each side independently so that each has a right of way, without potential potential to cross paths. The first does not work because of the alignment of the lanes and the second could work if signaled that way. The other issue is there are two lights for each direction of Pleasant Grove Road and only one lane in each direction. This does not make sense and was a waste of money. \r\n\r\nI see confusion among drivers each time I am at this intersection and countless near-miss accidents. This was a half-way done (for lack of a more appropriate term) and needs to be fixed BEFORE someone gets hurt. The attached graphic depicts the traffic pattern that seems to be used at this light and shows 4 potential accident locations. There is another alternative traffic pattern that seems to be used by drivers less frequently that creates greater potential for head-on collisions. \r\n\r\nI am concerned about this light as I use it multiple times a day and each time, there is an issue. I drive with my toddler in the back seat and I worry about her safety.

I worry that it will only be a matter of time before someone is seriously injured or killed trying to cross this street in the crosswalk.\r\nMy question is two fold:\r\n#1. What do we need to do to get a permanent street light in that lights the crosswalk in this location?\r\n\r\n#2. What do we need to do to get cross walk flashers that could be activated by anyone using the cross walk to help drivers see those people who are using the cross walk to cross the street? There are existing yellow lights that the crossing guards use activate when they are helping children cross the road. Would it be possible to install a system in which those trying to cross the street could manually activate before trying to cross the street in the crosswalk?\r\n\r\n What can we do to make this crosswalk safer?
